        <h3>My Story</h3>
        <p>I was born in Taiwan and mostly grew up in California, after my parents immigrated to the US when I was little.  I have lived all over California; Southern, Central Valley, Central Coast, and Northern California.  My parents both have five kids in their family, with four boys and one girl, however, on one side the girl is the oldest (my mom) and on the other side the girl is the youngest.  I am an only child, although I always wanted siblings.  My Myers-Briggs personality type is INTJ, which is rare, however being a female INTJ, I am the rarest personality type.  My sense of humor is dark and sarcastic, and I like to laugh at the funny, ironic, and/or absurd.  INTJs are often cast as the evil, masterminding villain in movies.  I am an introvert and often am in my own mind.  I need lots of time alone to re-charge, as interacting with people, although fun, is draining for me.  I like food, travel, languages, culture, music, movies, exercise, innovation and ideas.  I learned everything I know from Public Television and Public Radio :).   </p>
